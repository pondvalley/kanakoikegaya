Text: The body’s curve line balances the straight line of the bottom of the cup. She looked for a place on the body where the cup can be placed balance upright. 
The only mediums used are the cup and the human body. Both parts of the human body and the cup do not express emotion, yet they are able to communicate by showing their attributes of their identities more precisely. Despite their differences, they affirm each other’s value as they emphasize non-verval communication. I believe that difference makes life more vibrant.
I believe that another presence is essential for recognizing itself. She wants to show the importance of observation more delicately and also have the opportunity to  come into contact with the thing that gives us a new interpretation in ordinariness.
