Text:

While hammering away at the white plaster structure, debris began to pile up, as the jute within the plaster became more and more exposed. 

The fragile remnants of the plaster conjure images of destruction and its inherent instability.The commanding presence of the white plinth stands in stark contrast beside it.

The two exist in contradiction with each other, yet a harmony emerges from it. This delicate balance makes casting judgement on the beauty of either irrelevant, as both exist in a constant state of dependence.
