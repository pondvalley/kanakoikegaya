Text:

A pair of foot arches molded in bronze. She embedded the sculpture into the ground of the park. The arches are a metaphor for 'unconscious territory’ that grows irrespective of our intentions.The weight of the sculpture creates a firm stance that shows how all things have gravity.

She wanted to realize again that we are supported by beautiful ground in which sometimes humans forget about. Also, one of the most important aspects of this installation is the awareness of  the difference between humans and nature. Humans and nature coexist by sharing the same space and time. Humans rely on nature for daily life while nature is supported by human customs and behaviors.
