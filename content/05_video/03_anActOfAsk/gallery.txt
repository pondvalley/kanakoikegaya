On an early morning in a London forest. The woman climbs the tree and bows her head and begins to cut her hair randomly. The viewer can see deep into the forest through the gap between her feet. Then, she sees a dog running to her. The dog runs around the hair that falls on top of the fallen leaves.

She did a menial task in unusual location in an unusual way to give a new sense of value. Rather than cutting her hair in a bathroom or salon, she decided to expand beyond the fixed location and cut her hair in the forest. to break out of the expected routine. 

In the current age, we live with an uncertain future. Flexibility, rather than an conservative mindset, will expand our minds and create an empathetic world.
